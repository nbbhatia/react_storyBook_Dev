# Getting Started with Create React App

1- In this Project I have create some components using react storyBook and then I create the basic web page using those components , and then hosted on local development machine and code pushed to a code repo.
2- I'm using Material-ui for layout of the page 
3- I have write some test cases using Codecepts with playwrite and did end to end testing.
4- Installed some packages like -
    a) `@mui/material`
    b) `codeceptjs`
    c) `playwright`
5- I have write some unit test cases by using jest.
